					Description

Created a BlackJack Game App 

Features:
		
This game features two players (a player and a dealer)

A deck of 52 cards 

Game description:

At the start of the game each player is dealt two cards from the deack by the dealer and based on the combined value of the card

Each player will get to choose to hit or stay. 
	hit = asking for an aditional card 
	stay = game is over or if the combined value of the card in hand is over 21
The player gets to start the game and once they done with their turn the dealer gets their turn to play the game.
Once the  the player or dealer is dealth 21 the game is over 
At the end of the game, the app displays who has more points 

					What I learned 

A deeper dive into object oriented programming

learning how to use multiple classes and methods 

how to properly call methods and learning that methods can be called multple times based on where and when they are needed

Placement is very important and help to diplay results properly to the screen.

Undersatnding the actual logic of the game itself is very important.
